Overview

This project implements an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates MongoDB Vector Search with large language models (LLMs) to deliver context-aware, fact-grounded responses from unstructured data.

Key Features

Document ingestion and preprocessing

Embedding generation using modern embedding models

MongoDB-native vector indexing and similarity search

Context injection into LLM prompts

Hybrid search (vector + keyword) and metadata filtering

Modular and scalable RAG architecture

Tech Stack

MongoDB Vector Search

Large Language Models (LLMs)

Embedding Models

Python / JavaScript (as applicable)

Use Cases

Question answering systems

Knowledge assistants

Document search and analysis

Enterprise AI applications

Outcome

The project demonstrates a production-ready RAG system that improves response accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and enables efficient semantic search over large-scale datasets.
